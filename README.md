ABSTRACT
     Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic disease requiring patients to know their blood glucose values in order to ensure blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible. Hence, the ability to predict blood glucose levels is of a great interest for clinical researchers. Improved forecasting of blood glucose could aid in the management of diabetes. Recently proposed neural network architectures that use stacked fully connected layers with residual back casting have achieved state-of-the-art performance on benchmark time series forecasting tasks. In this sense, the literature is rich with several solutions that can predict blood glucose levels. Unfortunately, these methods require the patient to specific their daily activities: meal intake, insulin injection and emotional factors, which can be error prone. To reduce this burden on the patent, this work proposes to use only continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data to predict blood glucose levels independently of other factors. To support this, regression and Time Series algorithms were investigated. Though promising, previous work ignores opportunities for additional supervision, and the use of fully connected layers fails to account for the temporal nature of the signal.
